==============
=  General	 =
==============

- Removed the 'configs' directory, as it is no longer used by the new build system.
- Fix compiling with G++ 8
- byacc 1.9 breaks 'yydebug' in src/moc/moc.y - yydebug disabled for now until fix is made.
- Update CMakeLists.txt to force use of byacc - as yacc is a link to bison on some systems.
- Remove unnecessary moc.t in src/moc/
